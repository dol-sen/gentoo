# repository.yml
#
# This is the repository configuration file for repoman modules and 
# individual checks (future)
#

# NOTE: for non-gentoo repos, any custom modules added will need their
# module names to the modules list in order for them to run.

# These are the non-mandatory modules that can be disabled/enabled.
# use -foo notation to disable, just like use flags
# Add custom modules to enable them too
